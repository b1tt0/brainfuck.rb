# brainfuck.rb
Brainfuck interpreter, made on Ruby without any dependencies.

## Running
In order to run your code, you have to make a file with it.
Then, clone this repository and execute the following command:
*`ruby main.rb <brainfuck filename> [stack size]`

*argument inside of [brackets] is optional. default stack size - 100

Keep in mind - there are no loops **yet**. I'm working on implementing it.
